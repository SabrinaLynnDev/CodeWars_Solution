You might know some pretty large perfect squares. But what about the NEXT one?

Complete the findNextSquare method that finds the next integral perfect square after the one passed as a parameter. Recall that an integral perfect square is an integer n such that sqrt(n) is also an integer.

If the argument is itself not a perfect square then return either -1 or an empty value like None or null, depending on your language. You may assume the argument is non-negative.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

function findNextSquare(sq) {
  // Return the next square if sq is a perfect square, -1 otherwise / none/ null
  
  //Step 1: see the argument was int*int
  
  //step 2: case one yes: then output (int+1)*(int+1)
  
  //Step 3: if not 

  let sqrtCheck = (sq**.5)
  
  if (Number.isInteger(sqrtCheck) == true){
    return ((sq**.5)+1)**2
  } else 
   return -1;  

}
